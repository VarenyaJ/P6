def: "A genomic genotype that does not specify the sex determining chromosomal features of its bearer (i.e. does not indicate the background sex chromosome complement)" []
comment: In practice, most genotype instances classified as sex-agnostic genotypes because they are not sex-specific. When a genotype is indicated to be that of a male or female, it implies a known sex chromosome complement in the genomic background. This requires us to distinguish separate 'sex-qualified' genotype instances for males and females that share a common 'sex-agnostic' genotype. For example, male and female mice that of the same strain/background and containing the same set of genetic variations will have the same sex-agnostic intrinsic genotype, but different sex-qualified intrinsic genotypes (which take into account background sex chromosome sequence as identifying criteria for genotype instances).

def: "An allele that varies in it sequence from what is considered the reference or canonical sequence at that location." []
comment: Note that what is considered the 'reference' vs. 'variant' sequence at a given locus may be context-dependent - so being 'variant' is more a role played in a particular situation. A 'variant allele' contains a 'sequence alteration', or is itself a 'sequence alteration', that makes it vary_with some other allele to which it is being compared. But in any comparison of alternative sequences at a particular genomic location, the choice of a 'reference' vs the 'variant' is context-dependent - as comparisons in other contexts might consider a different feature to be the reference.  So being 'variant' is more a role played in a particular situation - as an allele that is variant in one context/analysis may be considered reference in another.\n\nA variant allele can be variant along its entire extent, in which case it is considered a 'sequence alteration', or it can span a broader extent of sequence contains sequence alteration(s) as part.  And example of the former is a SNP, and an example of the latter is a variant gene allele that contains one or more point mutations in its sequence.

def: "A genomic feature set representing all 'variant single locus complements' in a single genome, which together constitute the 'variant' component of a genomic genotype." []
comment: A 'complement' refers to an exhaustive collection of *all* objects that make up some well-defined set. Such a complement may contain 0, 1, or more than one members. The notion of a complement is useful for defining many biologically-relevant sets of sequence features.  Here, a 'genomic variation complement' is the set of all 'single locus complements' in a particular genome that harbor some known variation.\n\nIn model organisms, the majority of genotypes describe variation at a single  location in the genome (ie only one 'single-locus variant complement')  that are variant realtive to some reference background. For example, the genotype instance 'fgf8a<t1282a/+>(AB)') exhibits a mutation at only one locus. But some genotypes describe variation at more than one location (e.g. a double mutant that has alterations in the fgf8a gene and the shh gene)).

Our axiom below uses has_part rather than has_member, however, to account for the fact that many 'genomic variation complements' have only one 'single locus variant complement' as members.

def: "A genomic feature that represents one of a set of versions of a gene (i.e. a haplotype whose extent is that of a gene)" []
comment: In SO, the concept of a 'gene' is functionally defined, in that a gene necessarily produces a functional product. By contrast, the concept of a 'gene allele' here is positionally defined - representing the sequence present at the location a gene resides in a reference genome (based on sequence alignment).  An Shh gene allele, for example, may be a fully functional wild-type version of the gene, a non-functional version carrying a deleterious point mutation, a truncated version of the gene, or even a complete deletion. In all these cases, an 'Shh gene allele' exists at the position where the canonical gene resides in the reference genome - even if the extent of this allele different than the wild-type, or even zero in the case of the complete deletion.\n\nA genomic feature being an allele_of a gene is based on its location in a host genome - not on its sequence. This means, for example, that the insertion of the human SMN2 gene into the genome of a mouse (see http://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/MGI:3056903) DOES NOT represent an allele_of the human SMN2 gene according to the GENO model - because it is located in a mouse genome, not a human one.  Rather, this is a transgenic insertion that derives_sequence_from the human SMN2 gene.  If this human SMN2 gene is inserted within the mouse SMN2 gene locus (e.g. used to replace mouse SMN2 gene), the feature it creates is an allele_of the mouse SMN2 gene (one that happens to match the sequence of the human ortholog of the gene).  But again, it is not an allele_of the human SMN2 gene.

Many will be 'wild-type' or at least functional gene alleles. But some may be alleles that are mutated or truncated so as to lack functionality.  According to current SO criteria defining genes, a 'gene' no longer exists in the case of a non-functional or deleted variant. But the 'gene allele' does exist -  and its extent is that of the remaining/altered sequence based on alignment with a  reference gene.  Even for completely deleted genes, an allele of the gene exists (and here is equivalent to the junction corresponding to the where gene would live based on a reference alignment).\n\nThis design allows us to classify genes and any variants of those genes (be they functional or not) as the same type of thing (ie a 'gene allele'), since classification is based on genomic position rather than functional capacity. This is practical for representation of variant genotypes which often carry non-functional versions  of a gene at a particular locus.

Only that some agent has used it to serve a reference role in defining a variant or locating a sequence.

comment: Conceptually, members of this collection are meant to be about the sum total genetic material in a single cell or organism. But these members need not be associated with an actual material in a real cell or organism individual.  For example, things like a 'reference genome' may not actually represent the material genome of any individual cell or organism in reality. Here, there may be no genomic material referents of the sequences in such a collection because the genome is tied to an idealized, hypothetical cell or organism instance. The key is that conceptually, they are still tied to the idea of being contained in a single genome. In the case of a genotype, the individual seqeunce members are not all about the genetic material of a singel cell or organism. Rather, it is the resolved sequence contained in the genotype that is meant to be about the total genomic sequence content of a genome - which we deem acceptable for classifying as a genetic locus collection.

comment: An inheritance pattern results from the disposition of a genetic variant to cause a particular trait or phenotype when it is present in a particular genetic and environmental context.  Here, "genetic context" refers to the allelic state of the variant, which depends on what other alleles exist at the same location/locus in the genome. Zygosities such as heterozygous and homozygous are simple, common examples of 'states' of an allele. \n\nThese genetic and environmental "interactions" of alleles play out at the level of the gene products produced by the causal alleles, and are observable in the pattern with which the trait caused by an allele is inherited across generations of individuals. Thus, an inheritance pattern such as dominance is not inherent to a single allele or its phenotype, but rather a result of the relationship between two alleles of a gene and the phenotype that results in a given environment. This also means that the 'dominance' of an allele is context dependent - Allele 1 can be dominant over Allele 2 in the context of Phenotype X, but recessive to Allele 3 in the context of Phenotype Y.

comment: This is not a deletion in the sense defined by the Sequence Ontology in that it is not the result of an 'excision' of nucleotides, but an unbalanced translocation event.  The allelic complement that results is comprised of the terminus or junction represented by this lost chromosomal segment, and the remaining normal segment in the homologous chromosome. The lost aneusommic chromosomal segment is typically accommpanied by a gained aneusomic chromosomal segment from another chromosome.\n\nLoss of translocated chromosomal parts can confer a monosomic condition to a region of the chromsome.

comment: 1. A feature being 'of genomic origin' here means only that its sequence has been located to the genome of some organism by alignment with some reference genome. This is because the sequence was originally identified in, or artificially created to replicate, sequence from an organism's genome. \n\n2. The location of a genomic feature is defined by start and end coordinates based on alignment with a reference genome. Genomic features can span any size from a complete chromosome, to a chromosomal band or region, to a gene, to a single base pair or even junction between base pairs (this would be a sequence feature with an extent of zero). \n\n3. As sequence features, instances of genomic features are identified by both their inherent *sequence* and their *position* in a genome - as determined by an alignment with some reference sequence. Accordingly, the 'ATG' start codon in the coding DNA sequence of the human AKT gene and the 'ATG' start codon in the human SHH gene represent two distinct genomic features despite having he same sequence, in virtue of their different positions in the genome.

comment: 'Wild-type' is typically contrasted with 'mutant', where 'wild-type' indicates a highly prevalent allele in a population (typically >99%), and/or some prototypical allele in a background genome that serves as a basis for some experimental alteration to generate a mutant allele, which can be selected for in establishing a mutant strain.\n\nThe notion of wild-type alleles is more common in model organism databases, where specific mutations are generated against a wild-type reference feature. Wild-type alleles are typically but not always used as reference alleles in sequence comparison/analysis applications. More than one wild-type sequence can exist for a given feature, but typically only one allele is deemed wild-type iin the context of a single dataset or analysis.

comment: An allele is a seqeunce feature at a genomic location where variation occurs (i.e. where >1 different sequence is known to exist). An allele can span only the extent of sequence known to vary (e.g. a single base SNP, or short insertion), or it can span a larger extent that includes one or more variable features as proper parts (e.g. a 'gene allele' that spans the extent of an entire gene which contains several sequence alterations).\n\nAlleles can carry 'reference' or 'variant' sequence - depending on whether the its 'state' matches that considered to be the reference at that location. Alleles whose state differs from the reference are called 'variant alleles', and those that match the reference are called 'reference alleles'. What is considered the 'reference' state at a particular location may vary, depending on the context/goal of a particular analysis. A 'sequence alteration' is a 'variant allele' that varies along its entire extent (i.e every position varies from that of some defined reference sequence).

comment: A 'complement' refers to an exhaustive collection of *all* objects that make up some well-defined set. Such a complement may contain 0, 1, or more than one members. The notion of a complement is useful for defining many biologically-relevant sets of sequence features. Here, a 'single locus complement' is the set of all alleles at a specified location in a particular genome. This complement is typically a pair of two features in a diploid genome (with two copies of each chromosome). E.g. a gene pair, a QTL pair, a nucleotide pair for a SNP, or a pair of entire chromosomes.\n\nThe fact that we are counting how many copies of the same *sequence* exist in a genome, as opposed to how many of the same *feature*, is what sets  feature-level concepts like 'single locus complement'. apart from sequence-level concepts like 'copy number complement'. To illustrate the difference, consider a duplication event that creates a new copy of the human APOE gene on a different chromosome. This creates an entirely new sequence feature at a distinct locus from that of the original APOE gene.  The 'copy number complement' for sequence defined by the APOE gene locus would have a count of three, as this sequence is present three times in the genome.  But the 'single locus complement' at the APOE gene locus would still have a count of two - because the duplicated copy is at a different location in the genome, and therefore does not represent a copy of the APOE locus.

comment: An extrinsic genotype describes variation in the 'expression level' of genes in a cell or organism, as mediated by transient, gene-specific experimental interventions such as RNAi, morpholinos, TALENS CRISPR, or construct overexpression. This concept is relevant primarily for model organisms and systems that are subjected to such interventions to determine how altered expression of specific genes may impact organismal or cellular phenotypes in the context of a particular experiment.\n\nThe 'extrinsic genotype' concept is contrasted with the more familiar notion of an 'intrinsic genotype', describing variation in the inherent genomic sequence (i.e. 'allelic state').  In G2P research, interventions affecting both genomic sequence and gene expression are commonly applied in order to assess the impact specific genomic features can have on phenotype and disease.  It is in this context that we chose to model 'extrinsic' alterations in expression as genotypes - to support parallel conceptualization and representation of these different types of genetic variation that inform the discovery of G2P associations.

In the extrinsic genotype shown here, the variation in shha is affected by a specific concentration of an shha-targeting morpholino (instead of a mutation in the shha gene).

As the former is described by the traditional notion of a genotype, it seems a rational leap to consider the latter akin to an 'extrinsic genotype' wherein the alterations are externally  applied rather than inherent to the genome. \n\nFinally, there is some precedent to thinking about such extrinsic modifications in terms of a genotype, in the EFO:0000513 ! genotype: \"The total sum of the genetic information of an organism that is known and relevant to the experiment being performed, including chromosomal, plasmid, viral or other genetic material which has been introduced into the organism either prior to or during the experiment.\"" xsd:string

comment: 1. Scope of 'Genetic State': \n'Genetic state' is considered quite broadly in GENO to describe two general kinds of 'states'.  First, is traditional notion of 'allelic state' - defined as the complement of alleles present at a particular location or locations in a genome (i.e. across all homologous chromosomes containing this location). Here, a genotype can describe allelic state at a specific locus in a genome (an 'allelic genotype'), or describe the allelic state across the entire genome ('genomic genotype'). Second, this concept can also describe states of genomic features 'extrinsic' to their intrinsic sequence, such as the expression status of a gene as a result of being specifically targeted by experimental interventions such as RNAi, morpholinos, or CRISPRs.\n\n2. Genotype Subtypes:\nIn GENO, we use the term 'intrinsic' for genotypes describing variation in genomic sequence, and 'extrinsic' for genotypes describing variation in gene expression (e.g. resulting from the targeted experimental knock-down or over-expression of endogenous genes).  We use the term 'effective genotype' to describe the total intrinsic and extrinsic variation in a cell or organism at the time a phenotypic assessment is performed. \n\nTwo more precise conccepts are subsumed by the notion of an 'intrinsic genotype': (1) 'allelic genotypes', which specify allelic state at a single genomic location; and (2) 'genomic genotypes', which specify allelic state across an entire genome.  In both cases, allelic state is typically specified in terms of a differential between a reference and a set of 1 or more known variant features.\n\n3. The Genotype Partonomy: \n'Genomic genotypes' describing sequence variation across an entire genome are 'decomposed' in GENO into a partonomy  of more granular levels of variation. These levels are defined to be meaningful to biologists in their attempts to relate genetic variation to phenotypic features. They include 'genomic variation complement' (GVC), 'variant single locus complement' (VSLC), 'allele', 'haplotype', 'sequence alteration', and 'genomic background' classes.  For example, the components of the zebrafish genotype "fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a>; fgf3<t24149/+>[AB]", described at  zfin.org/ZDB-FISH-150901-9362, include the following elements:\n\n - GVC: fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a>; fgf3<t24149/+> (total intrinsic variation in the genome)\n - Genomic Background: AB (the reference against which the GVC is variant)\n - VSLC1:  fgf8a<ti282a/ti282a> (homozygous complement of gene alleles at one known variant locus)\n - VSLC2:  fgf3<t24149/+> (heterozygous complement of gene alleles at another known variant locus)\n - Allele 1:  fgf8a<ti282a>   (variant version of the fgf8a gene, present in two copies)\n - Allele 2:  fgf3<t24149>    (variant version of the fgf3 gene, present in one copy)\n - Allele 3:   fgf3<+>    (wild-type version of the fgf3 gene, present in one copy)\n - Sequence Alteration1: <ti282a>  (the specific mutation within the fgf8a gene that makes it variant)\n - Sequence Alteration2: <t24149> (the specific mutation within the fgf3 gene that makes it variant)\n\nA graphical representation of this decomposition that maps each element to a visual depiction of the portion of a genome it denotes can be found here: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/GENO-ontology/blob/develop/README.md\n\nOne reason that explicit representation of these levels is important is because it is at these levels that phenotypic features are annotated to genetic variations in different clinical and model organism databases For example, ZFIN typically annotates phenotypes to effective genotypes, MGI to intrinsic genotypes, Wormbase to variant alleles, and ClinVar to haplotypes and sequence alterations. The ability to decompose a genotype into representations at these levels allows us to "propagate phenotypes" up or down the partonomy (e.g. infer associations of phenotypes annotated to a genotype to its more granular levels of variation and the gene(s) affected). This helps to supporting integrated analysis of G2P data.

This coarser level does not capture more granular levels of variation commonly represented in other forms of genotypes (e.g. specific alleles and sequence alterations).   \n\nA base karyotype representing a genome with no known structural variation can be as simple as '46XY', but karyotypes typically contains some gross variant component (such as a chromosome duplication or translocation).

comment: We distinguish the notion of a sex-agnostic intrinsic genotype, which does not specify whether the portion of the genome defining organismal sex is male or female, from the notion of a sex-qualified intrinsic genotype, which does.  Male and female mice that contain the same background and genetic variation complement will have the same 'sex-agnostic intrinsic genotype', despite their genomes varying in their sex-chromosome complement.  By contrast, these two mice would have different 'sex-qualified intrinsic genotypes', as this class takes background sex chromosome sequences into account in the identity criteria for its instances.\n\nConceptually, a sex-qualified phenotype represents a superset of sequence features relative to a sex-agnostic intirnsic genotype, in that if specifies the background sex-chromosome complement of the genome.

This allows for the propagation of phenotypes associated with a sex-qualified genotype to the intrinsic genotype.  Ontologically, this parthood is based on the fact that the background component of a sex-qualified genotype specifies the sex chromosomes while that of the sex-agnostic genotype does not.

comment: A genomic feature is any located sequence feature in the genome, from a single nucleotide to a gene into an entire chromosome. 'Sets' are used to represent entities that are typically collections of more than one member - e.g. the set of chromosomes that make up the human genome. But we allow for sets that contain 0 members (an 'empty' set) or 1 member (a 'singleton' or 'unit' set), consistent with the concept of 'mathematical sets'. For example, a 'single locus complement' at an X-linked locus in a XY male will consist of only one allele, as there is only one X-chromosome in the genome. Note also that sets may contain duplicates (i.e. more than one member representing the same feature). For example, a homozygous 'single locus complement' is a set comprised of two of the same feature.\n\nThe notion of a 'genomic feature set' differs from that of a 'genomic sequence set' in that we are counting how many copies of the same *sequence feature* exist in a genome, as opposed to how many of the same *sequence*. 'Genomic feature sets are useful for representing things like 'single locus complements', where members are sequence features whose identity is dependent on their location. By contrast, 'genomic sequence sets' are useful for describing things like 'copy number complements', which are concerned only with how many copies of a sequence exist in a genome, regardless of the location where these reside.

Intrinsic attributes include things like allelic state, allelic phase.  Extrinsic attributes include things like its cellular distribution and chromosomal band intensity.

comment: 1. A sequence feature location is defined by its begin and end coordinates on a reference sequence, but it is not identified by a particular sequence that may reside there. The same location, as defined on a particular reference, may be occupied by different sequences in the genome of organism 1 vs that of organism 2 (e.g. if a SNV exists within this location in only one of the organisms).\n\n2. The notion of a sequence feature location in the realm of biological sequences is analogous to a BFO:spatiotemporal region in the realm of physical entities. A spatiotemporal region can be 'occupied by' physical objects, while a genomic location is 'occupied by' sequence features. Just as a spatiotemporal region is distinct from an object that occupies it, so too a genomic location is distinct from a sequence feature that occupies it. As a more concrete example, consider the distinction between a street address and the building that occupies it as analogous to the relationship between a genomic locus and the sequence feature that resides there.

def: "A set of discrete, genetically-linked sequence alterations that reside on the same chromosomal strand and are typically co-inherited within a haplotype block." []
comment: A haplotype is a set of non-overlapping alleles that reside in close proximity on the same DNA strand. We model them as 'complements' because they include all known/relevant alleles within a defined region in the genome (e.g. a 'gene', or a 'haplotype block') - where this set may consist of 0, 1, or more alterations from some reference.  Because they are genetically linked, the alleles comprising a haplotype are likely to be co-inherited and survive descent across many generations of reproduction. \n\nAs highlighted in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype, the term 'haplotype' is most commonly used to describe the following scenarios of genetic linkage between 'alleles':\n\n1. The 'alleles' comprising the haplotype are 'single nucleotide polymorphisms' (SNPs) or other small alterations, which  collectively tend to occur together on a chromosomal strand). This use of 'haplotype' is commonly seen in phasing of patient WGS or WES data, to describe a state where two or more alterations that are believed to occur 'in cis' on the same chromosomal strand.  \n\n2. The 'alleles' comprising the haplotype are SNPs or other short alterations, which collectively define a specific version of a gene. In this case, the locaiton bounding the haplotype corresponds to a gene locus, and the haplotype defines a specific allele of that gene (i.e 'gene allele'). "Star alleles" of PGx genes are examples of this category of haplotype (e.g. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ipd/imgt/hla/get_allele_hgvs.cgi?A*33:01:01, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4724253/).\n\n3. Each of the 'alleles' comprising the haplotype is itself a 'gene allele' (i.e. a specific version of an entire gene), such that the haolotype contains multiple complete 'gene alleles' that are co-inherited because they reside in tightly linked clusters on a single chromosome.   \n\nEach of these more specific definition serves a purpose for a particular type of genetic analysis or use case. The GENO definition of 'haplotype' is broadly inclusive of these and any other scenarios where distinct 'alleles' of any kind on the same chromosomal strand are genetically linked, and thus tend to be co-inherited across successive generations.

name: obsolete genetic dosage
comment: Genetic dosage reflects how many 'functional' copies of a sequence are present in a genome. In diploid organisms, the normal dosage is 2 for autosomal genes/regions. Dosage increases if there is a duplication of the gene/region. Dosage decreases if there is either a deletion of a gene/region, or an inactivating mutation that eliminates gene function. This sets it apart from the notion of 'copy number', which reflects how many actual copies of a sequence exist in a genome. Addition of a non-functional allele of a gene will increase its copy number, but not increase its dosage.\n\nDuplications of a sequence can occur at new locations in the genome, such that the resulting sequence represents a distinct sequence feature from the copy at its native locus.  For example, duplication of a region containing the human APOE gene on a different chromosome creates a sequence feature that shares sequence from the original gene, but not location, and therefore represents a different sequence feature.  The notions of dosage and copy number are therefore concerned with sequence-level entities (how many copies of a 'sequence' exist), as opposed to sequence feature-level entities.  The notion of a single-locus complement would be used to describe how many of a particular features are present in a genome - and describe which alleles of this feature are found.

comment: "Humans are diploid organisms; they have paired homologous chromosomes in their somatic cells, which contain two copies of each gene. An allele is one member of a pair of genes occupying a specific spot on a chromosome (called locus). Two alleles at the same locus on homologous chromosomes make up the individual’s genotype. A haplotype (a contraction of the term ‘haploid genotype’) is a combination of alleles at multiple loci that are transmitted together on the same chromosome. Haplotype may refer to as few as two loci or to an entire chromosome depending on the number of recombination events that have occurred between a given set of loci. Genewise haplotypes are established with markers within a gene; familywise haplotypes are established with markers within members of a gene family; and regionwise haplotypes are established within different genes in a region at the same chromosome. Finally, a diplotype is a matched pair of haplotypes on homologous chromosomes."\nFrom https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4118015/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4118015/figure/sap-26-03-165-g002/

comment: 1. A genomic location (aka locus) is defined by its begin and end coordinates on a reference genome, independent of a particular sequence that may reside there.  In GENO, we say that a genomic location is occupied_by a 'sequence feature' - where the identity of this feature depends on both it sequence, and its location in the genome (i.e. the locus it occupies).  For example, the 'ATG' sequence beginning the ORF of the human SHH gene shares the *same sequence* as the 'ATG' beginning the ORF of the human AKT gene. But these are *distinct sequence features* because they occupy different genomic locations. \n	\n2. A given genomic location (e.g. the human SHH gene locus) may be occupied by different alleles (e.g. different alleles of the SHH gene). Within the genome of a single diploid organism, there is potential for two alleles to exist at such a locus (i.e. two different versions of the SHH gene).  And across genomes of all members of a species, many more alleles of the SHH gene may exist and occupy this same locus.\n\n3. The notion of a genomic location in the realm of biological sequences is analogous to a BFO:spatiotemporal region in the realm of physical entities. A spatiotemporal region can be occupied_by physical objects, while a genomic location is occupied_by sequence features. Just as a spatiotemporal region is distinct from an object that occupies it, so too a genomic locus is distinct from a sequence feature that occupies it.  As a more concrete example, consider the distinction between a street address and the building that occupies it as analogous to the relationship between a genomic location and the feature that resides there.

We will work to resolve these questions and ideally converge these concepts in the future.\n\nWe don't link a Genomic Location to a specific reference sequence because in the FALDO model (which GENO adopts with the exception of swapping GENO:Genomic Locus for FALDO:Region), allows the start and end positions of a region to be defined on separate reference sequences.

def: "A haplotype is an allele that represents one of many possible versions of a 'haplotype block', which defines a region of genomic sequence that is typically 'co-inherited' across generations due to a lack of historically observed recombination within it." []
comment: 1. The relationship between 'haplotype' and 'haplotype block' is analogous to the relationship between 'gene allele' and 'gene':  a 'gene allele' is one of many possible instances of a 'gene', while a 'haplotype' is one of many possible instances of a 'haplotype block'.  In this sense, a gene allele can be considered to be a haplotype whose extent is that of a gene (as it is generally true that there is a low probability of recombination within any given gene).\n\n2. Haplotypes typically contain more than one 'genetically-linked' loci where sequence alterations are known to exist, such that a set of alterations will be co-inherited together across many generations of reproduction.  A common use of 'haplotype' is in phasing of patient WGS or WES data, where this term refers to sequence containing two or more alterations that are beleived to occur 'in cis' on the same chromosomal strand.  \n\nGENO's definition is consistent with but more inclusive than this view, allowing for haplotypes with one or zero established alterations as long as there is a low probability of recombination within the region it spans (such that alterations found in cis are likely to remain in cis across successive generations). As a result, GENO considers any allele that spans an extent greater than that of a single sequence alteration to be a haplotype - as long as there is an expectation of low recombination frequency within the haplotype block occupied by the allele. For example, a 'gene allele' is a haplotype representing a particular version of a gene that contains one or more sequence alterations - as a 'gene' is a region of sequence with a low probability of recombination that is generally expeted to be inherited as a unit. \n\n3. As highlighted in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype, the term 'haplotype' is most commonly used to describe the following scenarios of genetic linkage between 'alleles':\n\na. The first is regions containing multiple linked 'gene alleles' - i.e. specific versions of entire genes that are co-inherited because they reside in tightly linked clusters on a single chromosome.  \nb. The second is a region containing multiple linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that tend to occur together on a chromosomal strand (i.e. be statistically associated).  This use of 'haplotype' is commonly seen in phasing of patient WGS or WES data, to describe a state where two or more alterations that are believed to occur 'in cis' on the same chromosomal strand.  \nc. A third, which is related to the previous case, occurs when the extent of region containing linked SNPs is that of a single gene.  In this case, the haplotype represents a 'gene allele' - a version of an entire gene defined by the set of sequence alterations it contains. We may consider this a haplotype as most genes are small enough that there is little chance of recombination events moving cis alterations onto separate chromosomes.\n\nThe GENO definition of 'haplotype' is broadly inclusive of these and any other scenarios where distinct 'alleles' of any kind on the same chromosomal strand are genetically linked, and thus tend to be co-inherited across successive generations.

But the criteria for membership in a functional copy number complement require only that the feature can perform the functions associated with the gene or genes at the defining location.  A gene allele that varies by only one nucleotide from the wild-type gene may not qualify if that alteration eliminates the function of the allele.  This represents an important distinction between 'copy number' and 'functional copy number'. The former is not concerned with the functionality of sequence copies - only that there is a duplication of sequence in the genome.

comment: 'Sets' are used to model entities that can be comprised of multiple discrete elements - but which can also contain zero or a single member.  An "Allele Set'  represents any collection of 0 or more discrete alleles found within a particular genome. The alleles in such a set can be located at distant or close locations in the genome, and if on the same chromosome can be in trans, in cis, or even overlapping  When the members of such a set are found 'in cis' on the same chromosome, they may constitute a 'haplotype'.  When found 'in trans' at the same location on homologous chromosomes, they may constitute a 'single locus complement'.

comment: 1. Features described by 'copy number' are larger regions of sequence spanning one or more complete genes, or large chromosomal segment. Copies of these regions often become distributed across a genome at unknown locations. By contrast, short repeats, such as tri-nucelotide 'CAG' repeats in the Huntingtin gene, occur at defined locations (adjacent to the originating 'CAG' sequence), and can therefore be modeled as proper alleles.  \n\n2. A copy number complement, like any sequence feature complement, is a set of features in a particular genome that meet some criterion. The criterion in this case is that their sequence maps to that of a particular location in a reference sequence.  So a copy number complement is the set of all features that share or align with a specified sequence defined on some reference. The sequence of member sequences need not exactly match that of the reference, as copies may accrue some alterations. What is important is that conceptually they represent exact or inexact copies of the reference sequence at a defining location.\n\n3. In a 'normal' diploid genome, the copy number complement for any feature (on a non-Y chromosome) contains two members.  A copy number variation occurs when a complement contains more or less than two members - as the result of deletion or duplication event(s). In GENO, a 'copy number variation' refers to a copy number complement' that has an abnormal number of members.

def: "A set representing the complement of all copies of a particular biological sequence (typically at the scale of complete genes or larger) present in a particular genome." []
comment: The count of how many of a particular sequences are found in a genome is the sequences 'copy number'. In diploid organisms, the normal copy number for sequences at most locations is 2 (a notable exception being those on the X-chromosome where normal copy number is 1). Variations in copy number occur if this count increases due to a duplication of the gene/region, or decreases due to a deletion of a gene/region. A driving use case for representing copy number is to support associations between variation in copy number of a particular sequence, and phenotypes or diseases that can result.\n\nA 'complement' refers to an exhaustive collection of *all* objects that make up some well-defined set. Such a set may contain 0, 1, or more than one members. The notion of a complement is useful for defining many biologically-relevant sets of sequence features, such as 'copy number complements' representing the set of all copies of a particular sequence in a genome. \n\nThe fact that we are counting how many copies of the same *sequence* exist in a genome here, as opposed to how many of the same *feature*, is what sets sequence-level concepts like 'copy number complement' apart from feature-level concepts like 'single locus complement'. To illustrate the difference, consider a duplication event that creates a new copy of the human APOE gene on a different chromosome. This creates an entirely new sequence feature at a distinct locus from that of the original APOE gene.  The 'copy number complement' for sequence defined by the APOE gene locus would have a count of three, as this sequence is present three times in the genome.  But the 'single locus complement' at the APOE gene locus would still have a count of two - because the duplicated copy is at a different location in the genome, and therefore does not represent a copy of the APOE locus.

property_value: IAO:0000116 "The identity of a 'copy number complement' instance is determined by the sequence defining its members, and their count (the number of times this sequence appears in a particular genome). In reality the sequence of each copy may not be identical, given the tendency of large regions to accumulate subtle variations. What matters is that they share a common origin/alignment with a defining location in a reference genome.\n\nWe represent the notion of copy number at the \"sequence level\" (as opposed to the \"sequence feature level\")  because we are concerned only with the number of copies of a sequence in a genome, and not the location of the features bearing this sequence. Consider a copy number complement comprised of three copies of the sequence defined by the location Chr8 100000-200000 on a GRCh38.2 reference genome.  In one person's genome, this sequence may appear at its normal location on Chromosome 8, as well as in duplications on chromosomes 5, and 12. In another genome the sequence might appear three times as well, but on chromosomes 8, 9, and 15.  When representing causal associations linking copy number to disease, it is important that these are considered to be *the same* copy number complement - because what a curator associates with a disease is the presence of three copies of some sequence in a genome, independent of their location. The \"sequence level\" representation here supports this use case.  By contrast, a \"feature level\" representation, where identity of a copy number complement would be based on the identity of member *features*), does not - because we have two sets comprised of entirely different features (based on location being tied to their identity)." xsd:string

The SO class, which is defined as a \"sequence feature level\" concept (and therefore represents a single continuous extent of sequence), refers to a sequence alteration such as a deletion or duplication that changes the copy number of the affected sequence, and would result in the presence of  a 'variant copy number complement'.  The presence of an SO 'copy number variation' suggests, but does not guarantee, the existence of a GENO 'variant copy number complement' (e.g. if a second balancing event has occurred).\n\nFor example, the deletion variant reported in the ClinVar record here (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/21009/) is a copy number variation in the SO sense - a deletion that likely results in a GENO 'variant copy number complement'. Databases like ClinVar and dbVar type such alterations as 'copy number variants'.  But ClinVar also describes 'variant copy number complements' that may result from the presence of one or more SO 'copy number variations' in a given genome, e.g. here ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/221691/).

comment: A 'complement' refers to an exhaustive collection of *all* objects that make up some well-defined set. Such a set may contain 0, 1, or more than one members. The notion of a complement is useful for defining many biologically-relevant sets of sequence features, such as the set of all functional copies of a particular sequence in a genome. This is known as the 'functional copy number' or 'genetic dosage' of the sequence.\n\n'Functional copies' of a sequence are those that exhibit normal activity and/or produce gene products that exhibit normal activity associated with the sequence. The count of functional copies of a gene is often referred to as its 'dosage'. In diploid organisms, the normal 'dosage' is 2 for autosomal genes/regions. Dosage increases if there is a duplication of a functional gene/region. Dosage decreases if there is either a deletion of a gene/region, or an inactivating mutation that eliminates gene function. This sets it apart from the notion of a 'copy number complement', which reflects how many copies of a sequence exist in a genome, regardless of their functionality. Addition of a non-functional allele of a gene will increase its copy number, but not increase its dosage.\n\nAs we saw for 'copy number complement', the defining sequence here is specified in terms of a location on a reference sequence - typically the location where a gene or set of genes resides.  But the criteria for membership in a 'functional' copy number complement require only that the feature can perform the functions associated with the gene or genes at the defining location.  A gene allele that varies by only one nucleotide from the wild-type gene may not qualify as functional if that alteration eliminates the activity of the allele.

comment: To allow users to make important distinctions in discourse and modeling, GENO clearly separates the notions/levels of 'biological sequence', 'sequence feature', and 'sequence location' ('genomic locus' when found in a genome). This sets up an important terminological nuance when it comes to alleles, where we believe it correct to say that a particular genomic feature is an alleles_of some genomic locus (as opposed to an allele_of some sequence or some feature). This is typically a gene locus, but even insertions falling outside of genes are considered alleles_of the locus they alter (e.g. alleles of other types of named loci such as QTLs, or alleles of some unnamed locus of arbitrary size).\n\nWhile conceptually it is most correct to say features are alleles_of some genomic locus, it is common practice to say that they are alleles of the class of feature defined to reside at that locus (typically a gene).  Accordingly, we may write things like "fgf8a<ti282a> is an allele of the Danio rerio fgf8a gene", and we may create data where fgf8a<ti282a> is asserted as an allele_of  the fgf8a gene class IRI. But here we mean more precisely that it is an allele of the locus at which the fgf8a gene resides.  Allowing for this means that we dont have to create 'feature-based location/locus' terms mirroing all feature class terms already in exiistence (e.g. for every gene).\n\nIt is important to be clear that the location/locus that a feature is an allele_of is defined exclusively by its genomic position, and not on the sequence it may contains. This is particularly relevant when considering transgenic insertions. For example, this means that the insertion of the S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene sequence within the D. melanogaster Bx gene locus would create an allele of the D. melanogaster Bx gene, but not an allele of the S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene. The transgene that results from such an insertion, while expressing S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene sequence, is not an allele of this gene because it does not reside at the S. cerevisiae GAL4 locus. \n\nThis departs from how some databases use the term 'allele' - where transgenes expressing an exogenous gene are considered to be alleles of the exogenous genes they carry.  For example, in the example above, Flybase describes the S. cerevisiae GAL4 transgene as an allele_of the  S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene (and gives it the allele identifier FBal0040476). A GENO representation on the other hand would say that the S. cerevisiae GAL4 transgene derives_sequence_from the S. cerevisiae GAL4 gene, but is not an allele_of this gene. In a GENO model, FBal0040476 would be typed as a transgene insertion, but not considered an allele_of the Scer\\GAL4 gene.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's just semantics, but worth clarifying given the ubiquity and variable use of the term 'allele'. The GENO model attempts to define and adhere to the principled notion of positionally-defined 'alleles', and functionally-defined 'transgenes'.

comment: In GENO we define three levels of sequence artifacts: (1) biological sequences, (2) sequence features, and (3) qualified sequence features. The identify criteria for a 'biological sequence' include only its inherent sequence (the ordered string of units that comprise it). The identity criteria for a 'sequence feature' include its sequence and position (where it resides - i.e. its location based on how it maps to a reference or standard) The identity criteria for a 'qualified sequence feature' include its component sequence feature (defined by its sequence and position), and the material context of its bearer in a cell or organism. This context can include direct epigenetic modification, or being targeted by gene knockdown reagents such as morpholinos or RNAi, or being transiently overexpressed from a transgenic construct in a cell or organism.

(Exploratory). There are cases where we may also want inter-genotype propagation (i.e. propagation that extends beyond moving up or down a single genotype). For example, if a phenotype is asserted on a sex-qualified intrinsic genotype, we want it to infer down through its component sex-agnostic intrinsic genotype and then up to any effective genotypes of which this sex-agnostic intrinsic genotype is a part.

For functional copy number complements (aka genetic dosage), it is the canonical function(s) performed by the sequence of this proxy feature (typically a gene) that helps to define sequences in a genome of interest that qualify for membership in the complement.

comment: Can be used when Interval objects are employed in representing sequence location.  But start and end positions can also be directly attached to a location, avoiding the use of Interval objects.

def: "A role assigned to a sequence feature, collection, or genotype, e.g. serving as a 'reference' against with other  sequences are compared." []
comment: The RO:0000087 (has role) property cannot be used here because its domain is explicitly constrained to independent continuants, and sequence features in GENO are generically dependent contnuants.
