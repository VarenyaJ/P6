LOINC Code

LOINC code	89692-8
name	Heart rate 10 minutes mean Fetus
description	In the early stages of development the fetal heart rate (FHR) is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system and arterial chemoreceptors. As gestation continues, the FHR decreases and its variability increases due to the maturation of the parasympathetic nervous system. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have recommended the adoption of standardized guidelines for the interpretation of FHRs. The following parameters of the fetal heart tracing should be systematically evaluated with both qualitative and quantitative descriptions: 1. Baseline rate 2. Baseline FHR 3. Presence of accelerations 4. Periodic or episodic decelerations 5. Changes or trends of FHR over time 6. Frequency and intensity of uterine contractions The baseline FHR is determined by measuring the heart rate for ten minutes that is rounded to the nearest 5 minute interval, and excludes stretches with significant FHR variability, periodic or episodic changes, and segments of baseline that vary by greater than 25 beats per minute. The baseline must last a minimum of two minutes, and if it is less than two minutes it will be considered indeterminate. A change in the baseline FHR is defined as a decrease or increase of heart rate that persists for more than ten minutes.[http://perinatology.com/Fetal%20Monitoring/Intrapartum%20Monitoring.htm]

LOINC Code

LOINC code	11633-5
name	Fetal Heart rate reactivity US
description	Heart rates are considered reactive ("normal") if two or more accelerations occur within a 20-minute period. Nonreactive heart rate is one in which not enough accelerations are detected in a 40-minute period and can be associated with several findings, including the fetus was asleep during the test in which case the test time may be extended. Nonreactive results can also occur if the mother is taking certain medications or that the fetus is not getting enough oxygen.[https://www.acog.org/]

Fetal Body weight Estimated   89087-1
LOINC Code

LOINC code	89087-1
name	Fetal Body weight Estimated
description	Fetal body weight is an important measurement variable for assessing both fetal and maternal health. There are many different methods for estimating fetal body weight, including ultrasound, fetal palpitation, and formulas based on various maternal measurements, such as fundal height. Variables that influence the accuracy of body weight estimation include whether the fetus is within the normal range for body weight given its gestational age, maternal body mass index, and the skill of the clinician estimating the weight. Ultrasound may be the most reliable method for estimating fetal body weight at term if the technology and an experienced ultrasonographer is available. [PMID: 28392581]

Fetal body weight/Heaviest fetus body weight US+Calculated   98032-6
LOINC Code

LOINC code	98032-6
name	Fetal body weight/Heaviest fetus body weight US+Calculated
description	The ratio of the body weight of one fetus compared to the weight of the heaviest fetus, also known as the estimated fetal weight ratio or EFWR, is a measure of discordance between multiple fetuses in a single pregnancy. It is used to calculate the estimated fetal weight discordance (EFWD) [LOINC: 98031-8], where EFWD = 1 - EFWR.

Fetal body weight/Heaviest fetus body weight US+Calculated   98032-6
LOINC Code

LOINC code	98032-6
name	Fetal body weight/Heaviest fetus body weight US+Calculated
description	The ratio of the body weight of one fetus compared to the weight of the heaviest fetus, also known as the estimated fetal weight ratio or EFWR, is a measure of discordance between multiple fetuses in a single pregnancy. It is used to calculate the estimated fetal weight discordance (EFWD) [LOINC: 98031-8], where EFWD = 1 - EFWR.

Noninvasive prenatal fetal aneuploidy panel - Plasma cell-free DNA   73967-2
LOINC Code

LOINC code	73967-2
name	Noninvasive prenatal fetal aneuploidy panel - Plasma cell-free DNA
description	Noninvasive prenatal testing for risk of fetal aneuploidy (e.g. trisomy 21, XXY, etc.) is performed using maternal plasma (or serum) which contains circulating cell free (ccf) DNA from the fetus. The probability and result interpretation (high risk/low risk) of aneuploidy are based on dosage ccf DNA from the mother and fetus as well as the mother's current age and gestational age. The ccf DNA includes both fetal and maternal DNA. This code is based, but not limited in use to, the submitter's test, Harmony Prenatal Test, which is a non-invasive prenatal test intended to aid in the risk determination of trisomy 13, 18 and 21 as well as fetal sex chromosome aneuploidy in women with singleton pregnancies of at least 10 weeks gestational age.

Chromosome X and Y aneuploidy in Plasma cell-free DNA by Dosage of chromosome-specific cfDNA Nominal   73822-9
LOINC Code

LOINC code	73822-9
name	Chromosome X and Y aneuploidy in Plasma cell-free DNA by Dosage of chromosome-specific cfDNA Nominal
description	Sex chromosome (X & Y) analysis to determine gender (XY or XX) or presence of aneuploidy can be determined based on dosage of chromosome specific ccf DNA in maternal plasma, the mother's current age and gestational age. The ccf DNA includes both fetal and maternal DNA. This code is based, but not limited in use to, the submitter's test, Harmony Prenatal Test, which is a non-invasive prenatal test intended to aid in the risk determination of fetal aneuploidy as well as trisomy 13, 18 and 21 in women with singleton pregnancies of at least 10 weeks gestational age. The submitter's lab reports results as male fetus, female fetus, or aneuploidy. For aneuploidy cases, the results of the specific findings (e.g. YY, XYY, XXX, etc.) are reported as well.

change reason	The system of 'Ser/Plas.maternal^fetus' was changed to 'Plas.cfDNA' (cfDNA from plasma, which includes both maternal and fetal DNA) to more precisely identify what is being measured. Changed Component from 'X & Y chromosome analysis' to clarify that the purpose of the measurement is to look for aneuploidy.; Added "Fetal" to Component to clarify that the result is about the fetus.
